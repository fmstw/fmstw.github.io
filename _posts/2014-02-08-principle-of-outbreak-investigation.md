Outbreak 雖然不是隨時會發生，但是我們都應該隨時做好準備！但是，究竟什麼是 Outbreak 呢？當一個 outbreak 發生後，我們又該如何面對挑戰？以下，我們將從定義出發，討論一個 outbreak 的管控需要考量的不同面向，並提供一個 10 steps 的處理方式給大家參考！大家可要細細研讀，我們 table training 再見啦！

**Principle of Outbreak Investigation**

1. Definition:
    - Outbreak/Epidemic: The occurrence of cases or other health-related events clearly in excess of normal expectancy. （只要疾病的發生率超出預期即可稱為outbreak，一例也可稱作outbreak）
    - Example1: SARS (2003): 8422 cases with 916 deaths (CFR=10.9%) in 29 countries
    - Example2: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (2012-2013): 80 cases with 25 deaths (CFR 56%)
    - Cluster: An aggregation of cases in a give place & time
    - Sporadic: A disease that sometimes occurs in an area
    - Endemic: A disease that normally occurs in an area
    - Pandemic: The epidemic that spreads over many countries (2 or more regions) of the world
2. Objectives of the outbreak investigation
    - Control the current outbreak 
    - Prevent future outbreaks 
    - Evaluate disease prevention programs
    - Evaluate effectiveness of the existing surveillance
    - Research for more knowledge of the disease
    - Respond to public or political concern
3. Surveillance in Taiwan
    - Emergency Operating Center （緊急醫療應變中心）
    - Disaster Management Assistant Team （國災隊）
4. Ten steps of an outbreak investigation 以下分項列出Outbreak因應的十個步驟內容，並說明可行的方式。
    - Confirm the existence of the outbreak. （確認疫情的存在）: Determine the expected number of cases before deciding if the observed number exceeds the expected.
    - Verify the diagnosis and determine the etiology of the disease. （找出病因）: Obtain medical records and lab reports and Conduct clinical testing if needed.
    - Develop a case definition, start case-finding, and collect information on cases. （解釋這個疾病並開始尋找資料）: An acute illness involving jaundice or elevated liver function tests occurring after visiting or residing in District A during May-August 2010
    - Describe persons, places, and times, and generate hypotheses. （設定一個假說）: Descriptive epidemiology: epi-curve, spot map, exposure
    - Test the hypotheses using an analytic study. （運用分析去測試假說）: Case-control study, cohort study
    - Carry out necessary environmental or other studies to supplement the epidemiological study. （去地區做實地研究）: Survey the surrounding. Find more cases
    - Draw conclusions to explain the causes or the determinants of the outbreak, based on clinical, laboratory, epidemiological, and environmental studies. （舉出結論）: The most possible source of an outbreak is a water supply
    - Report and recommend appropriate control measures to concerned authorities at the local, national, and if appropriate, international levels. （對政府機關做出建議）: Quarantine and isolation of individuals to reduce spread
    - Communicate the findings to educate other public health professionals and the general public. （把發現跟醫療團體與大眾做說明）: Response to media attention important to address public concerns about outbreak
    - Follow up the recommendations to ensure implementation of control measures. （事後做追蹤去確保防範措施）: Check the result!!!
5. 行前小練習：瞭解一個曾經發生過的outbreak案例，嘗試以10 steps進行推演。
